This Python script integrates web scraping using BeautifulSoup and automated form submission using Selenium. Initially, the `scrape_data` function retrieves property information such as links, prices, and addresses from a Zillow clone webpage. It achieves this by making a GET request to the specified URL and parsing the HTML content with BeautifulSoup. The parsed data is then extracted into lists for further processing.

Subsequently, the `automate_form_submission` function utilizes Selenium to automate the input of scraped data into a Google Form. It configures a Chrome WebDriver, maximizes the browser window for visibility, and sets up WebDriverWait to handle dynamic loading of page elements. For each property in the scraped lists, the function navigates to the Google Form, waits for input fields to load using explicit waits, clears existing inputs, and enters corresponding property details (address, price, link). After submitting each form entry, it waits for confirmation and clicks on "Submit another response" to prepare for the next input cycle, with optional sleep intervals to manage page loading times effectively. This approach ensures efficient and systematic data transfer from web sources to form-based applications, suitable for various data collection and survey automation tasks.
